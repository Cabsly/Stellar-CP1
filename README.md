## 1. The application domain and the research problem
The application domain for this research problem is astronomy and astrophysics. In this field, the classification of celestial objects is an important task as it helps astronomers understand the properties and characteristics of these objects. With the recent discovery of a celestial object by NASA, it is necessary to use classification algorithms to determine its nature. The goal is to classify the object as either a star, a galaxy, or a quasar.
Stars, galaxies, and quasars are three distinct types of celestial objects that can be observed in the universe. Stars are massive, luminous balls of gas that generate energy through nuclear fusion in their cores. They are the most common type of celestial object and are found throughout the universe. Galaxies, on the other hand, are vast collections of stars, gas, dust, and other celestial objects held together by gravity. Quasars are a type of active galactic nucleus and are some of the most luminous objects in the universe. They are believed to be powered by supermassive black holes at their centers.
The research problem at hand involves the development and application of classification algorithms to accurately determine the nature of the newly discovered celestial object. This will require the use of various data sources and techniques. The data collected from these sources will be
used to train the classification algorithms and improve their accuracy. The ultimate goal is to accurately classify the object, which will allow astronomers to learn more about its properties and how it fits into the larger context of the universe. For example, if the object is classified as a star, astronomers can learn more about its size, mass, temperature, and other characteristics. If it is classified as a galaxy or quasar, they can learn
more about its structure and its role in the universe. Classification algorithms have been widely used in the field of astronomy to classify celestial objects and improve our understanding of the universe. However, the development of more advanced and accurate algorithms is an ongoing research area. In this project, we are goingthrough some of them.
